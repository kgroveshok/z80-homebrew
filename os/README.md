z80-Homebrew OS
---------------

Custom extended monitor which is the OS to my retro machine.

I have a particular love for Forth and the Jupiter Ace has been of interest so I want to make a system that 
runs Forth as the OS, allows access to hardware specifics, file system and as the programming language
instead of the retro BASIC that most use.

This code is what you will find here. 

I have duplicated it out of the stage3.2 dir and will leave what is there there and develop further here.
