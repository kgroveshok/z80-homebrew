Z80 Home Brew Micro-computer Project
------------------------------------

Having watched so many retro computing videos on YouTube I thought I would relive some of my youth
by building something simple. I remember the old electronic magazines of the 1980's which 
had plenty of simple programmable computing devices to make at home.  Always wanted one. Now I
will do it - only a few decades behind :-)


6502 vs Z80
-----------

My first home computer was a Vic20. Not long after having that in my grubby mitts I was writing
6502 machine code, hand assembling as we all did back then. Later I moved onto an Amstrad CPC464
and dived into Z80 which I then took to the Amstrad PCW 512.

Looking around at parts I found it hard to locate any good 6502 parts and with the vast
Z80 community and lots of great material to dust off my rusty electronics skills I chose that.

Therefore this project, is Z80 based. Turns out that is a good choice as the arch is very simple
with a load of great chips that tie closely together. Makes for an easier life.


Progress
--------

Check the DEV-DIARY.md for progress and what I learnt - spoiler, it is alot!



Parts
-----

At each stage I will document and attach the schematics for mostly for my own reference should things go wrong.

I found so much great advice and inspiration around the net here are some of those that made the most
impact (in no particular order):
